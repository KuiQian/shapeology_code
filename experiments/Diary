Add sections in reverse Chronological order

Friday, July 12, 2019
1. Show hsv images classified by good/bad, structures, train/test sequentially.
Further step: turn good/bad into both good, both bad, and train good but test bad. Divide images of paired structure into two sides.
2. Show time each step took during the process.
Further step: move load DM part to init. If possible, try to improve DM source codes.

Next step:
1. Perform cell extraction on the whole section with patches with no overlap. Experiment with patch size on EC2.
2. Store patches in pandas table. (Suggest: SQLite)
3. Calculate scores for shifted structures.
