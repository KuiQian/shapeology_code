preprocessing:
  polarity: -1  # invert polarity of image (cells are dark)
  min_std:  10  # if tile has std smaller than min_std then it is
                # ignored as "too smooth"
  offset:   -20 # offset used in cv2.adaptiveThreshold
  min_area: 10  # Patches with area smaller than min_area are ignored

normalization:
  size_thresholds: [15,51,251]  # patches are padded to one
                              # of these sizes so that a set of
                            # patches is represented as a 3D numpy array
