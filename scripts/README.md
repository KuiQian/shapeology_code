## Guidlines for Cell Shape Analysis
## First step: Generating cell patches
This step is to extract cells from each brain section's image.
### How to run
#### 1. Extracting cells from single section
This script extracts all of cells from a given file. Get filename and yaml path as input and generate directory based on filename.
```
python extractPatches.py <filename>.tif yaml
```
```
optional arguments:
  <filename>.tif    The image file to process
  yaml              Path to Yaml file with parameters

generate:
  directory called <filename>_cells. Directory contains one file per padding size. The patches in each file are randomly permuted.
```
#### 2. Running extractPatches.py on all sections of one brain
This script uses datajoint.populate and Cells_extractor.py to excute extractPatches.py on all sections of a given brain.
```
python Cell_datajoint/Cells_extract_datajoint.py configure.yaml stack
```
```
optional arguments:
  configure.yaml   Path to Yaml file with parameters and passwords
  stack            The name of the brain, type=str, default='MD594'
```
To speed up the process, this script can be run on multiple AWS instances 
([More information](Aws-jupyter.md)).

## Second step: Training for diffusion map
### Process
#### 1. Permute cells in a random order
```bash
python SortFile_v2.py file_num cell_num
```
``` 
optional arguments:
    file_num   Number of permuted files to generate, defult=K
    cell_num   Number of cells in one permuted file, defult=M
```
This script is to process the cell files generated by `Cells_extract_datajoint.py`
and prepare them for analysis by K-means. 
* In `extractPatches.py`, cells are stored in files per padding sizes and permuted randomly already for each section.
* We create K files for each padding size with M cells in every
file. 
* In one file, collect cells from each section based on the proportion
 of the number of cells in each section to the total. Then permute these 
 cells in a random order.

#### 2. Find representative samples via K-means
```
python CreateVQs_v2.py padded_size samples_size
```
```
positional arguments:
  padded_size    One of the three padded size, 15, 51 or 201
  samples_size   Number of samples taken for K-means
```
This script is to conclude cells into representative samples with 
a limited number.
* Find representative cells of a specific number first.
* Divide cells into clusters based on representative cells and take the 
the mean of each cluster as representative samples.
